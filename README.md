# Main sequence of scripts to run simulations:

1_simulation_parameters.R: specify various types of simulations you'd like to run.

2_preprocess_slurm_output.R: slurm outputs the results in a list format. This script will bind it into a nice dataframe, and save the dataframe into the ./analysis_results/preprocessing/ folder. This dataframe will have each row represent one "step" in every simulation, i.e. one addition of a batch of participants and checking of the bayes factor.

3_summary_stats_many_altNs.R: this script takes the dataframe generated by the 2_preprocess_slurm_output.R script. It will calculate the probabilities of supporting H1/H0/undecided, depending on various maxN limits.

4_plot_maxN_by_power.R: this script will take the sumstats.RData file produced by 3_summary_stats_many_altNs.R script, and produce power plots.

## Folders:

data:
Where the raw data output from slurm is copied to and left untouched.

analysis_output:
For preprocessing and other stats results from various analysis. 

utils:
folder containing various helper functions.
